ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Daniel - a software engineer primarily interested in [distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), [decentralized finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance), and [algorithmic trading]({{< ref "/pages/Learn Trading" >}}). I'm currently building high performance, low latency bidding systems forÂ [Martin](https://martin.ai/) that support billions of requests per day, most of which are written in [Go]({{< ref "/pages/Go" >}}). 

As a self-taught software developer, I've spent a considerable amount of time studying Computer Science through reading books, papers, blog posts, and taking online or in-person courses. Taking notes on what I've learned and regularly reviewing them is the only way I've found to truly learn a given topic.

I've tried a lot of different [tools]({{< ref "/pages/Tools I Use" >}}) for note taking, but I've settled on using [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) for capturing my notes. Roam is unlike almost any other tool due to its first class support of [bi-directional linking](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) which ultimately forms a personal [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). 

This site is in fact a flattened section of this graph where you'll find a collection of my notes, thoughts, and ideas. I am constantly adding new notes (both new and old) and make no guarantees as to their "production readiness", so do keep that in mind. Here are some links to get you started:
