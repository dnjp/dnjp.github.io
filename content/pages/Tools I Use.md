I’ve tried a __lot__ of different tools looking for those that are reliable, a joy to use, and visually appealing when applicable. These are the tools I’ve arrived at and currently use:

  + [**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

    + An elegant and efficient text editor that balances productivity and configurability.

  + [**Sublime Merge**](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)

    + A desktop Git client that pairs well with Sublime Text. While nothing beats the power of Git on the command line, the majority of the time what I need is simple. Diffing, composing commits, handling merge conflicts, and branch management make up 90% of the features I regularly use in Git and having a GUI makes each of these tasks significantly easier.

  + [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/)

    + A modern terminal that is pleasant to use.

  + [**Roam Research**](https://roamresearch.com/)

    + Roam is a powerful knowledge management tool and it is where I dump my notes, thoughts, and ideas all throughout my day. The tagging features of Roam enable me to quickly search, find, and pull together notes from different contexts into a cohesive structure.

  + [**TablePlus**](https://tableplus.com/)

    + The best database manager I’ve used on MacOS that supports both SQL and a variety of NoSQL databases.

  + [**Arq Backup**](https://www.arqbackup.com/)

    + Dependably backs up my MacOS machine to cloud storage.

  + [**Alfred**](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

    + The rest of the features I wish were built right into MacOS - hotkeys, text snippets, scripting, all the MacOS automation your heart could desire.

  + [**Karabiner-Elements**](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

    + Keyboard customizer for MacOS that most importantly allows me to remap CapsLock to both Escape and Control.

Software I used to use

  + [**Acme**](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/acme/)

    + Rob Pike’s text editor from [Plan 9]({{< ref "/pages/Plan 9" >}}).

  + [**Nyne**](https://github.com/dnjp/nyne)

    + Nyne is a configuration tool and event processing library that I wrote for Acme/Edwood. You can think of it as the `.vimrc` for Acme.

  + [**nvi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvi)

    + nvi is the text editor originally distributed with the Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD).

  + [**Vim**](https://www.vim.org/)

    + Vi IMproved - The most widely used "standard" vi implementation

  + [**Emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

    + The Emacs Lisp interpreter that happens to also be a text editor 

  + [**Linux**](https://www.linux.org/)

    + The target platform for most of the software I write. When using it on the Desktop, I got tired of constant display and audio issues which, of course, work almost flawlessly on [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/).
